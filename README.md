# ATM

This project is a simulation of an ATM system designed to handle multiple users simultaneously by leveraging multi-threading. The primary goal of this project is to replicate the core functionalities of a real-world ATM while ensuring a seamless experience for concurrent users.

Features:
Multi-threading Support: Enables multiple users to access the ATM system concurrently without interference, ensuring smooth operation in real-time.
User Authentication: Secure login functionality to ensure that only authorized users can access their accounts.
Core Banking Operations:
  Check Balance: View the current account balance.
  Deposit Funds: Add money to the account.
  Withdraw Funds: Safely withdraw money while ensuring sufficient balance.
Thread Safety: Proper synchronization mechanisms are implemented to avoid data corruption or conflicts when multiple threads access shared resources.
Purpose:
This project demonstrates how multi-threading can be used to manage multiple users in a simulated ATM environment, providing an efficient and responsive system. It serves as a practical example of concurrency management in software development.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Multi-threading Concepts: Thread creation, synchronization, and shared resource handling.
